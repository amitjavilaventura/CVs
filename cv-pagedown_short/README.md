# Pagedown-based CV

This is my CV made with the Made with the R package [`pagedown`](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown). R package and the `html_resume` template.

To print it as PDF, you must turn the `self_contained` option in the YAML header to true, visualize it in the navigator and print (CTRL+P) it to PDF. 

I have retrieved some code, specially the `styles.css` file from [wjakethompson](https://github.com/wjakethompson/cv).

Feel free to use any code you want, but do not use my personal data.
